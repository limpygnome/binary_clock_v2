Service Rules
***************
1.	Services should only be added when the application launches.

2.	Services should only be removed when the entire controller is shutdown; this
	is because a service may reference another service during runtime (all services
	are shutdown when the controller is not running).

3.	Services are not started in any particular order, thus the prerun() function
	should be used for loading any data, settings or any pre-run configuration
	which another service may depend upon. No inter-service communication
	should occur at this stage.

4.	The prerun() function is not executed as a separate thread; the thread used is
	the same one invoking start() on the service controller.

5.	Any services left in the controller when the destructor of the controller is
	invoked, will be deleted.
